# CrawlerProject
Crawler4j project with depth search and other algorithms

The first crawling strategy is depth-first search. In depth-first search, the frontier acts like a last-in first-out
stack. The elements are added to the stack one at a time. The one selected and taken off the frontier at any
time is the last element that was added.

The second crawling strategy is the best-first crawler. In this strategy pages are visited in the order specified
by the priority values in the frontier. The priority is specified based on an estimate of the value of the linked
page. The estimate can be based on topological properties (e.g. the in-degree of the target page) or content
properties (e.g. the similarity between a query keyword and the source page).
